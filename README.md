# Bioportal Ontology Selector
BOS is a Python script that uses the Bioportal Annotator software to find either one or multiple ontologies that are the most suitable to annotate a semi-structured biological dataset. It relies on 5 functions and a json configuration file detailing which data, ontologies, and parameters are to be evaluated. 

##  Running through CLI
After setting up configurations, type the command:
```
BOS "config.json"
```
