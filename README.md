# Bioportal Ontology Selector
BOS is a python script that uses the Bioportal Annotator to find either one or multiple ontologies that are the most suitable to annotate a semi-structured biological dataset. 

It relies on 5 functions and a json file detailing which data, ontologies, and parameters are to be evaluated. 

##  Running BOS
The script can be used through command line interface, by tiping:
```
